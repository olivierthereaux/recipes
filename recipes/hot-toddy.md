For one warming, steaming cup of hot toddy:
* 125ml of water
* 2 whole cloves
* 2 juniper berries
* 1 star anise
* 1 whole cardamon
* about an inch (2.5cm) of a cinnamon stick
* about an inch of a piece of ginger, or more if you like it spicier
* half an unwaxed lemon
* 8oz brandy, rum, whisky or whiskey
* a teaspoonful of honey

1. Use a paring knife to slice off some lemon peel, and to remove the skin off the ginger. Slice the ginger thinly. 
2. Put all the lemon peel, ginger, and spices into the water in a saucepan and bring to a boil. 
3. Turn it down to a gentle simmer until you can smell the spices.
4. Heat up your drinking vessel, either by pouring some boiling water in it, or I sometimes put a bit of water and microwave it for 30 seconds. Discard the water. 
5. Squeeze lemon juice into your cup, and pour in the shot of brandy, rum, whisky or whiskey. 
6. Take the saucepan off the stove and pour in the liquid through a sieve into your cup. 
7. Stir in the honey.
8. Drink!
